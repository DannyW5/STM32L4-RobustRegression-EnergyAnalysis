# STM32L4-RobustRegression-EnergyAnalysis

## Quick Overview
This repository contains code for the STM32L476 microcontroller, aimed at investigating the performance and energy consumption of robust linear regression estimators.

## Project Description

This repository contains code for the STM32L476 microcontroller, aimed at investigating the performance and energy consumption of robust linear regression estimators. The study will focus on the energy usage of these estimators under various conditions, including different supply voltages, operating modes, clock frequencies, and CPU temperatures.

The following robust regression estimators will be tested:

- **Theil-Sen Estimator**
- **RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus)**
- **Huber Regression**
- **Siegel Estimator**

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the energy efficiency of these estimators on the STM32L476 platform, which is crucial for optimizing performance in ene
